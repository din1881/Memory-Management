# Memory-Management

This is a memory management simulator (education friendly tool), this is a part of our coursework in the Operating Systems Course. <br>
This project focuses on implementing memory allocation and deallocation algorithms and simulating it using C++ and Qt. <br>
<br>
Our GUI is user friendly and self explanatory :metal:.

## Dependencies for using the simulator: <br>
- [ ] Windows OS (different steps could be required in any other OS) <br>
- [ ] Qt

## Running the program:
1. Clone this GitHub repo. <br>
2. Open Qt terminal. <br>
3. Copy the "build" folder path to the Qt terminal using the next command: <br>
``` cd "path" ``` <br>
4. Then type this command: <br>
```windeployqt.exe --quick --no-translations . ``` <br>
5. The exe file will be generated in the the build folder. <br>
